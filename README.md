# Team Project

KV6002 Team Project and Professionalism Module
INSTALL NODE.JS

## Currently Installed Modules:

Express |
SQLite3 |
Body-parser

### To check exactly what is installed, look at 'dependencies' of 'package.json', don't edit that file at all though.

### The SQlite3 exe is there to test the database file, making sure the data is working

### To reset the database run the db.js file, 'node db.js'

### To the lecturer marking this, follow the instruction below:

You must install node.js, the exact version being used here is v20.18.0
The Modules here should already be installed, make sure you are in the correct directory of 'TEAM-PROJECT'
To run the website, type in the terminal 'node server.js' and it should run and show you the URL it is hosted on
If not, it is likely the modules are not installed correctly
It would be very unlikely, but just in case then try run:
npm install express
npm install sqlite3
npm install body-parser

### Test data

The backend is the least developed of the project, but if you want to test the sign in features working try these username and passwords:
Username: testName password: testpass
Username: testName2 password: testpass2
